First of all, some basic exploratory data analysis was performed on the data sample.


Two issues were found:

1. Missing values in \texttt{user\_id} column.
Such records were excluded.

2. Duplicated review texts of the same book (under distinct ids) by the same user. 
Such records were excluded as they don't contain any useful information in the context of market-basket analysis of book.

The distribution of basket sizes was analysed. The vast majority of users have only one review - it means that the majority of baskets contain only one item.
Consequently, the analysis can be limited to analysing frequent pairs (doubletons).

At last, string item ids were converted to integer ids to reduce RAM and CPU consumption.
