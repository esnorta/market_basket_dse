In this project work the market-basket analysis is performed on the \textit{Amazon book reviews} dataset covering the entire process from data processing and algorithms implementation to defining association rules.
\newline
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Concepts and applications of market-basket analysis are discussed;
	\item A-Priory and PCY algorithms are implemented, brief analysis of their advantages and limitations is provided;
	\item PCY algorithm performance is assessed in terms of RAM usage;
	\item Cosine similarity is used to enhance association rule outputs;
	\item A simple MapReduce solution is implemented to improve the algorithm performance.
\end{enumerate}

Although the implementations are developed mostly from scratch they already yield meaningful results concerning association rules.
